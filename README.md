Hello! I'm Rose White, a current senior computer science/ digital media major at Taylor University. My hobbies include hiking, learning new things, and coding beautiful user experiences!

I've interned as a Software Developer @ Samaritan's Purse('21) and Kratos Defense ('20). My roles extended across the full stack, but I especially enjoyed front-end development.

I'm hoping to do full-stack development or tech consulting post-college. Enjoy looking at my work!
